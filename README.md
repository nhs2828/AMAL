# AMAL - Advanced MAchine Learning & Deep Learning
Here are my courses in Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Sorbonne University.

We have learnt to:
- Use Pytorch, lightning, optuna
- Data cleaning, data transformation, and data integration
- Recurrent neural network such as: RNN, LSTM, GRU for forecasting, seq2seq and translation
- CNN for sentiments classification
